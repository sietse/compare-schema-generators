class AccumulationKindValue(Enum):
    """
    :cvar VALUE_0: Not Applicable, or implied by the unit of measure.
    :cvar VALUE_1: A value from a register which represents the bulk
        quantity of a commodity. This quantity is computed as the
        integral of the commodity usage rate. This value is typically
        used as the basis for the dial reading at the meter, and as a
        result, will roll over upon reaching a maximum dial value. Note
        1: With the metering system, the roll-over behaviour typically
        implies a roll-under behavior so that the value presented is
        always a positive value (e.g. unsigned integer or positive
        decimal.) However, when communicating data between enterprise
        applications a negative value might occur in a case such as net
        metering.Note 2: A BulkQuantity refers primarily to the dial
        reading and not the consumption over a specific period of time.
    :cvar VALUE_2: The sum of the previous billing period values and the
        present period value. Note: “ContinuousCumulative” is commonly
        used in conjunction with “demand.” The “ContinuousCumulative
        Demand” would be the cumulative sum of the previous billing
        period maximum demand values (as occurring with each demand
        reset) summed with the present period maximum demand value
        (which has yet to be reset.)
    :cvar VALUE_3: The sum of the previous billing period values. Note:
        “Cumulative” is commonly used in conjunction with “demand.” Each
        demand reset causes the maximum demand value for the present
        billing period (since the last demand reset) to accumulate as an
        accumulative total of all maximum demands. So instead of
        “zeroing” the demand register, a demand reset has the affect of
        adding the present maximum demand to this accumulating total.
    :cvar VALUE_4: The difference between the value at the end of the
        prescribed interval and the beginning of the interval. This is
        used for incremental interval data. Note: One common application
        would be for load profile data, another use might be to report
        the number of events within an interval (such as the number of
        equipment energizations within the specified period of time.)
    :cvar VALUE_6: As if a needle is swung out on the meter face to a
        value to indicate the current value. (Note: An “indicating”
        value is typically measured over hundreds of milliseconds or
        greater, or may imply a “pusher” mechanism to capture a value.
        Compare this to “instantaneous” which is measured over a shorter
        period of time.)
    :cvar VALUE_9: A form of accumulation which is selective with
        respect to time. Note : “Summation” could be considered a
        specialization of “Bulk Quantity” according to the rules of
        inheritance where “Summation” selectively accumulates pulses
        over a timing pattern, and “BulkQuantity” accumulates pulses all
        of the time.
    :cvar VALUE_10: A form of computation which introduces a time delay
        characteristic to the data value
    :cvar VALUE_12: Typically measured over the fastest period of time
        allowed by the definition of the metric (usually milliseconds or
        tens of milliseconds.) (Note: “Instantaneous” was moved to
        attribute #3 in 61968-9Ed2 from attribute #1 in 61968-9Ed1.)
    :cvar VALUE_13: When this description is applied to a metered value,
        it implies that the value is a time-independent cumulative
        quantity much a BulkQuantity, except that it latches upon the
        maximum value upon reaching that value. Any additional
        accumulation (positive or negative) is discarded until a reset
        occurs. Note: A LatchingQuantity may also occur in the downward
        direction – upon reaching a minimum value. The terms “maximum”
        or “minimum” will usually be included as an attribute when this
        type of accumulation behaviour is present.When this description
        is applied to an encoded value (UOM= “Code”), it implies that
        the value has one or more bits which are latching. The condition
        that caused the bit to be set may have long since evaporated.In
        either case, the timestamp that accompanies the value may not
        coincide with the moment the value was initially set.In both
        cases a system will need to perform an operation to clear the
        latched value.
    :cvar VALUE_14: A time-independent cumulative quantity much a
        BulkQuantity or a LatchingQuantity, except that the accumulation
        stops at the maximum or minimum values. When the maximum is
        reached, any additional positive accumulation is discarded, but
        negative accumulation may be accepted (thus lowering the
        counter.) Likewise, when the negative bound is reached, any
        additional negative accumulation is discarded, but positive
        accumulation is accepted (thus increasing the counter.)
